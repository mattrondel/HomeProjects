**Technical Preparation**
- Review fundamental security concepts: CIA triad
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
Confidentiality like making sure data is kept secret or private.
Integrity is data is trustworthy and free from tampering like a hash / checksum on files
Availability data is useless unless it is available to those in the organization and the customers they serve

Defense in depth - gives administrators time to launch countermeasures dmz's are good examples of this or vlan separation 
zero trust architecture - strict identity verification for every user and device attempting to access resources 2fa is a good example of this like rsa tokens, something you own and have

- Be ready to discuss specific security frameworks you've worked with (NIST, ISO 27001, etc.)
Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover
- Prepare examples of security tools you've used: 
SIEM platforms mcaffee McAfee Enterprise Security Manager (ESM)
Vulnerability scanners - scap 
Firewalls juniper, SonicWALL, little cisco firepower exp had an in person class on it
Endpoint protection - Epo/trellix being biggest but other ones like avast
- Think through incident response scenarios and your methodology for handling them
Possible answers:
I havn't worked/experienced an incident response in dod space before but I have been researching (via cissp curiosity) and understand that there are systematic processes to detect, respond to, and mitigate security incidents.
or
this would be new territory for me and this is what excites me about this role I hope to never have to experce it but I do my best work when I'm learning and growing
or
while I haven’t experienced in incident response in dod spaces I have mitigated risks such as a spread of ransomware through several small businesses
or 
I haven’t used that software before / in depth but I'm a quick learner with new technologies. when I needed to master Cisco ISE for a previous role I build a lab at home and practiced with real hardware until i was proficient.

**Common Question Categories to Expect**
- **Scenario-based questions**: "How would you handle a suspected malware infection?" or "Walk us through securing a new cloud deployment"
- **Technical depth questions**: About encryption, network security, access controls, or specific technologies
- **Compliance questions**: Your experience with audits, regulatory requirements, risk assessments
- **Behavioral questions**: Times you've had to communicate security risks to non-technical teams or balance security with business needs
see below for WEP, Vlan, Palm Ranch Water district

**Key Areas to Highlight**
- Your hands-on experience with security technologies and tools
mcaffee McAfee Enterprise Security Manager (ESM)
mcaffee epo aka trellix, implementing by hand (IAC is possible just not experienced it yet)
- Examples of security projects you've led or contributed to significantly
cross domain solutions - xarbitor troubleshooting bad words

- Your ability to translate technical risks into business language
WEP at doctors offices
vlans for ransomware
was working on large scale project for hotel chain down here failed (PCI DSS) audit and needed terminals seprated from guest network
(credit card and also local water district network separation/wireless

- Continuous learning efforts (certifications, training, staying current with threats)
az-104 is latest taken courses
just renewed ccna, sec+
EPolicy Orchestrator 5.10 Essentials completed on 04/2021

**Questions to Ask Them**
- What are the biggest security challenges facing the organization currently?



- What security tools and technologies does the team currently use?



- How does the security team collaborate with other departments?



- What opportunities are there for professional development and certification?

Here are effective interview questions organized by key areas for an Information Systems Security Engineer role:

**Technical Security Knowledge**
- Walk me through how you would conduct a security risk assessment for a new application or system
- Describe the difference between vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, and when you'd use each
- How would you respond to a suspected data breach? What are your first three steps?
- Explain defense in depth and give me examples of how you've implemented it
- What's your approach to securing cloud infrastructure versus on-premises systems?

**Incident Response & Problem-Solving**
- Tell me about a time you had to investigate a security incident. What was your methodology?
- How do you stay current with emerging threats and vulnerabilities?
- Describe a situation where you had to balance security requirements with business needs
- What would you do if you discovered a critical vulnerability in a production system that couldn't be immediately patched?

**Compliance & Governance**
- How do you approach security compliance frameworks like SOC 2, ISO 27001, or industry-specific regulations?
- Describe your experience with security audits and how you prepare for them
- How do you document and communicate security policies to non-technical stakeholders?

**Technical Implementation**
- What security tools and technologies have you worked with? Which do you prefer and why?
- How do you approach network segmentation and access controls?
- Explain your experience with identity and access management systems
- What's your process for security architecture reviews?

**Soft Skills & Communication**
- How do you explain complex security risks to executives or business users?
- Describe a time you had to push back on a business request due to security concerns
- How do you prioritize security initiatives when resources are limited?
- Tell me about a time you had to collaborate with development teams on secure coding practices

These questions will help you assess both technical competency and the practical experience needed for the role.
