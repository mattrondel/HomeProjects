Ah, I misunderstood! You're the one being interviewed FOR the Information Systems Security Engineer position. Here's how to prepare for the types of questions you're likely to face:

**Technical Preparation**
- Review fundamental security concepts: CIA triad
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
Confidentiality like making sure data is kept secret or private.
Integrity is data is trustworthy and free from tampering like a hash / checksum on files
Availability data is useless unless it is available to those in the organization and the customers they serve

Defense in depth - gives administrators time to launch countermeasures dmz's are good examples of this or vlan sepration 
zero trust architecture - strict identity verification for every user and device attempting to access resources 2fa is a good example of this like rsa tokens, something you own and have

- Be ready to discuss specific security frameworks you've worked with (NIST, ISO 27001, etc.)
Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover
- Prepare examples of security tools you've used: 
SIEM platforms, 
vulnerability scanners, 
firewalls juniper, sonicwall, little cisco firepower had an in person class on it
Endpoint protection - Epo being biggest but other ones like avast
- Think through incident response scenarios and your methodology for handling them

**Common Question Categories to Expect**
- **Scenario-based questions**: "How would you handle a suspected malware infection?" or "Walk us through securing a new cloud deployment"
- **Technical depth questions**: About encryption, network security, access controls, or specific technologies
- **Compliance questions**: Your experience with audits, regulatory requirements, risk assessments
- **Behavioral questions**: Times you've had to communicate security risks to non-technical teams or balance security with business needs

**Key Areas to Highlight**
- Your hands-on experience with security technologies and tools

- Examples of security projects you've led or contributed to significantly
xdomain solutions

- Your ability to translate technical risks into business language
wep at doctors offices
vlans for ransomware
- Continuous learning efforts (certifications, training, staying current with threats)

**Questions to Ask Them**
- What are the biggest security challenges facing the organization currently?
- What security tools and technologies does the team currently use?
- How does the security team collaborate with other departments?
- What opportunities are there for professional development and certification?
