“What are some of the challenges your team is facing right now?”

What are the biggest challenges your team faces? 

What are the goals we’d like to achieve in the next 3 and 6 months?

 I’ve read the job posting, but can you tell me more about the day to day responsibilities?

“What is the work schedule like?”


    What does a day in the life of this role look like?
    What is your favorite part of the company culture?
    If I were to get this role, how will I know I'm successful within the first 3 months? What are some important metrics or KPIs I would be contributing to?

    And I always end with, "What are the next steps?"
